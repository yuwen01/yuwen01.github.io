Hi! My name's Yuwen, and I'm a Master's student at UC Berkeley adviced by Professor Raluca Ada Popa. I also did my undergrad at Berkeley, earning a B.A. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. Check out my resume [here](assets/resume.pdf)!

In August 2024, I'll start working as an engineer at [Succinct](https://succinct.xyz)!
