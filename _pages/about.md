Hi! My name's Yuwen, and I'm a Software Engineer at [Succinct Labs](https://succinct.xyz)! I completed my Master's at UC Berkeley advised by Professor Raluca Ada Popa, studying cryptography and systems security. I also did my undergrad at Berkeley, earning a B.A. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. Check out my resume [here](../assets/resume.pdf)!

Outside of work, I enjoy running and baking for my friends!
