Hi! My name's Yuwen, and I'm a Master's student at UC Berkeley adviced by Professor Raluca Ada Popa. I also did my undergrad at Berkeley, earning a B.A. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. In my free time, I like running, playing video games, and making food for people I care about. 

In August 2024, I'll start working as an engineer at [Succinct](https://succinct.xyz)!
